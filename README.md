# Postall

This is a newsfeed generator that relies on Masonry to create a collection/grid of your favorite sites (which includes Youtube, Flickr, and Soundcloud)

After searching for your favorite terms on each of those sites you can add it to your personal collection.

This was built with a standard MVC model using NodeJS, MongoDB and Handlebars.js

To Run the program, make sure you have MongoDB and NodeJS installed:

1) cd into the downloaded project and run mongod --dbpath dataStorage
2) In another terminal call: node app.js
3) Visit localhost:3000 and use the site
